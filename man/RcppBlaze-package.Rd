\title{R and Blaze Integration}
\description{
RcppBlaze construct a bridge between R and Blaze.
}
\details{
'Blaze' is an open-source, high-performance C++ math library for dense and sparse arithmetic.
With its state-of-the-art Smart Expression Template implementation \strong{Blaze} combines the elegance and
ease of use of a domain-specific language with HPC-grade performance, making it one of the most
intuitive and fastest C++ math libraries available. The \strong{Blaze} library offers:
\itemize{
  \item high performance through the integration of BLAS libraries and manually tuned HPC math kernels
  \item vectorization by SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4, AVX, AVX2, AVX-512, FMA, and SVML
  \item parallel execution by OpenMP, C++11 threads and \strong{Boost} threads
     (\strong{Boost} threads is disables in \strong{RcppBlaze})
  \item the intuitive and easy to use API of a domain specific language
  \item unified arithmetic with dense and sparse vectors and matrices
  \item thoroughly tested matrix and vector arithmetic
  \item completely portable, high quality C++ source code
}

The \strong{RcppBlaze} package includes the header files from the \strong{Blaze} library with disabling some
functionalities related to link to the thread and system libraries which make \strong{RcppBlaze} be a
header-only library. Therefore, users do not need to  install \strong{Blaze} and the dependency \strong{Boost}.
\strong{Blaze} is licensed under the New (Revised) BSD license, while \strong{RcppBlaze}
(the \strong{Rcpp} bindings/bridge to \strong{Blaze}) is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later,
as is the rest of \strong{Rcpp}.

Note that since \strong{Blaze} has committed to C++14 which does not used by most \strong{R} users from version 3.0,
we will use the version 2.6 of \strong{Blaze} which is C++98 compatible to support the most compilers and system.

\section{Caution}{

On the windows x64 with \strong{Rtools33}, \strong{Rtools34}, \code{std::ptrdiff_s} is defined as \code{long long unsigned int},
so do not direct wrap the dimention of matrix or the size of vector to output in case the compiling error occurs.
}

\section{Using RcppBlaze}{

The simplest way to get started is to create a skeleton of a package
using \code{RcppBlaze}. This can be done conveniently by the
\code{\link{RcppBlaze.package.skeleton}}
function.

The important steps are
\enumerate{
\item Include the \samp{RcppBlaze.h} header file, which also includes \samp{blaze/Blaze.h}.
\item Import \code{Rcpp}, LinkingTo \code{Rcpp}, \code{BH} and \code{RcppBlaze} by adding these lines to the \samp{DESCRIPTION} file:
\preformatted{
  Imports: Rcpp (>= 0.11.0)
  LinkingTo: Rcpp, BH, RcppBlaze
}
\item Link against the \code{BLAS} and \code{LAPACK} libraries, by adding following two lines in the \samp{Makevars} and
\samp{Makevars.win} files:
\preformatted{
  PKG_LIBS = $(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS)
}
}
