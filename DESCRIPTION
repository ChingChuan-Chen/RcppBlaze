Description: 'Blaze' is an open-source, high-performance C++ math library
    for dense and sparse arithmetic. With its state-of-the-art Smart Expression
    Template implementation Blaze combines the elegance and ease of use of a
    domain-specific language with HPC-grade performance, making it one of the most
    intuitive and fastest C++ math libraries available. The Blaze library offers:
    - high performance through the integration of BLAS libraries and manually
    tuned HPC math kernels - vectorization by SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4, AVX,
    AVX2, AVX-512, FMA, and SVML - parallel execution by OpenMP, C++11 threads and
    Boost threads (Boost threads is disables in RcppBlaze) - the intuitive and easy
    to use API of a domain specific language - unified arithmetic with dense and
    sparse vectors and matrices - thoroughly tested matrix and vector arithmetic -
    completely portable, high quality C++ source code The RcppBlaze package includes
    the header files from the Blaze library with disabling some functionalities
    related to link to the thread and system libraries which make RcppBlaze be
    a header-only library. Therefore, users do not need to install Blaze and the
    dependency Boost. Blaze is licensed under the New (Revised) BSD license, while
    RcppBlaze (the Rcpp bindings/bridge to Blaze) is licensed under the GNU GPL
    version 2 or later, as is the rest of Rcpp. Note that since latest version of
    Blaze (3.0) commit to C++14 which does not used by most R users, we will use the
    version 2.6 of Blaze which is C++98 compatible to support the most compilers and
    system.
