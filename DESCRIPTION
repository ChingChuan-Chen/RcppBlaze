Description: 'Blaze' is an open-source, high-performance C++ math library
    for dense and sparse arithmetic. With its state-of-the-art Smart Expression
    Template implementation 'Blaze' combines the elegance and ease of use of a
    domain-specific language with 'HPC'-grade performance, making it one of the most
    intuitive and fastest C++ math libraries available. The 'Blaze' library offers:
    - high performance through the integration of 'BLAS' libraries and manually
    tuned 'HPC' math kernels - vectorization by 'SSE', 'SSE2', 'SSE3', 'SSSE3', 'SSE4', 
    'AVX', 'AVX2', 'AVX-512', 'FMA', and 'SVML' - parallel execution by 'OpenMP', C++11 
    threads and 'Boost' threads ('Boost' threads are disabled in 'RcppBlaze') - the 
    intuitive and easy to use API of a domain specific language - unified arithmetic 
    with dense and sparse vectors and matrices - thoroughly tested matrix and vector 
    arithmetic - completely portable, high quality C++ source code The 'RcppBlaze' 
    package includes the header files from the 'Blaze' library with disabling some 
    functionalities related to link to the thread and system libraries which make 
    'RcppBlaze' be a header-only library. Therefore, users do not need to install 
    'Blaze and' the dependency 'Boost'. 'Blaze' is licensed under the New (Revised) 
    BSD license, while 'RcppBlaze' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to 'Blaze') is licensed 
    under the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the rest of 'Rcpp'. Note that since 
    'Blaze' has committed to 'C++14' commit to 'C++14' which does not used by most R users
    from version 3.0, we will use the version 2.6 of 'Blaze' which is 'C++98' compatible 
    to support the most compilers and system.
