Description: Blaze is an open-source, high-performance C++ math library for dense and sparse arithmetic. 
    With its state-of-the-art Smart Expression Template implementation Blaze combines the elegance and 
    ease of use of a domain-specific language with HPC-grade performance, making it one of the most 
    intuitive and fastest C++ math libraries available. The 'RcppBlaze' package includes the header files 
    from the 'Blaze' library with disabling some functionalities related to link to the thread and system
    libraries which make 'RcppBlaze' be a header-only library. Therefore, users do not need to install 
    'Blaze'. 'Blaze' is licensed under the New (Revised) BSD license, while 'RcppBlaze' 
    (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to 'Blaze') is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the 
    rest of 'Rcpp'.
